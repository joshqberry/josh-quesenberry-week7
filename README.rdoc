Data Model
- Users have
  - user_name, string.
  - password_digest, string.
  - about, string.

- Courses have
  - title, string.
  - day/night, boolean. (it either happens as a night class or day class)

Rails View Stories

Application layout should have login link if no current user and logout link if there is a current user.



2. Authentication for Users
    - login page

Login page:

user_name:
password:
Login

Courses Index Page

Title           | day or night
statistics 101  | Day            | Delete Course

Capybara Stories

User Authentication

Test valid users can log in.

Courses Crud

Test that users can CRUD courses.




SO PEOPLE CAN STILL GO TO WHATEVER PAGE BY TYPING IN URL, DO I NEED TO FIX?

before_action :authenticate

private
def authenticate
unless current_user
  redirect_to â€˜/login'
end
end
